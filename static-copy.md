## Rules and Regulations

## Sign Up Instructions
For the given quarter, there will be a table of hikes for each week. The table includes information about the hike
so that you can decide whether it's a good fit for you. 
- The first column lists the `Week` during which the hike will take place
  - For example: `Week 2` typically means that the hike will occur on the weekend of `Week 2`
- The `Difficulty` column indicates how punishing the hike is. This is usually based off of elevation gain.
  - For example: a `hard` hike might have 2500ft of elevation gain while an `easy` hike has 50
- The `Location` and `Trailhead` columns include links to either a Google Maps location or site about said trail
- The `Distance` column is only an approximation of how many miles the trail is
- The `Drive Time` column indicates how long it will take to drive to the trailhead from campus
  - Please us this to narrow down whether you can commit to a far drive as it oftens takes up the day
 
### Non-Drivers


### Drivers
If you have a car and would be willing to drive fellow students to the trailhead, please let one of the officers know.
Drivers are reimbursed for gas whenever possible. Often, the passengers will each Venmo $5 to the driver. (For far hikes,
we may increase the asked amount to account for the difference in gas expenditure). We are always looking for drivers
so please reach out.

## Hikes
List of all the hikes the club has done. Note that all hikes from Spring 2020 to Spring 2021 were NOT hosted by the 
club but given as suggestions because of the current Covid-19 epidemic. For those using these hikes as suggestions, 
please be mindful of Covid restrictions for that county, maintain your distance (6ft apart), wear a mask, and stay safe.
Also be aware that hiking in California from May - October has recently been impacted by wildfires and bad air quality so
always check the conditions before heading out. We hope that Fall 2021 will allow the club to resume hosting hikes.
